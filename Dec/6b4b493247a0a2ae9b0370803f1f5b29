JUDGE Nkola Motata, who has been on paid special leave since his drunken driving incident in 2007, yesterday turned to the high court in Pretoria to challenge the appointment of a tribunal to probe complaints against him.He appeared before the tribunal in June 2013, but the proceedings were postponed indefinitely pending the outcome of his constitutional challenge against certain provisions of the Judicial Services Act.The judge made headlines when he plunged his Jaguar through the wall of a Hurlingham, Joburg, home one night in 2007.The judge allegedly said: No boer is going to undermine me; this used to be the white man s land but not anymore. The words allegedly uttered that night are the subject of an investigation. A senior Joburg advocate and AfriForum laid complaints of alleged misconduct against him with the Judicial Service Commission (JSC).It regarded the complaints as serious enough to warrant an investigation. The judge was informed in February 2013 that the JSC had requested Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng to appoint a tribunal to probe the complaints.The 66-year-old judge, in a highly technical submission advanced by his advocate Bantubonke Tokota SC, yesterday asked that the decision to establish a tribunal be declared inconsistent with the constitution.
