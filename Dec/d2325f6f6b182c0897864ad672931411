Pretoria - Emotional scenes played out in court on Tuesday as a cellphone video clip taken while a matric pupil was tied to a tree, doused in petrol and set alight, was viewed by a judge and legal counsel.The two women accused of killing Boitumelo Dlamini sat with their heads in their hands, crying in the dock. Dlamini s blood-curdling screams could be heard echoing through the courtroom.Cynthia Mosupi, 23, and Sharon Gugu Twala, 24, are facing a charge of murder in the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, following the death of Dlamini, who suffered burns across 70% of her body.She died in a veld near Klipgat, north of Pretoria.The pair pleaded not guilty and said they wanted to simply teach Dlamini a lesson as she was meddling in Mosupi s love life. It is claimed that Dlamini had an affair with Mosupi s boyfriend.The pair claimed they just poured the petrol over Dlamini, but she went up in flames when someone else lit a cigarette on the scene.Their friend Victor Pilane was at the scene during the incident last year and took a video clip on his cellphone. The short clip did not depict the setting alight of Dlamini, but recorded the scene seconds before that, when the accused tried to tie her to a tree.The prosecution asked Judge Tshifhiwa Maumela for permission to hand in the video clip while Pilane was giving testimony.Counsel for Twala objected and said she knew exactly what was on the clip and did not want to view it again because it was too traumatising.Judge Maumela allowed Twala s objection and said that while viewing such evidence was part of a court s daily work, it could have lasting effects for those directly involved, as it was a life-changing event for them.But he ordered counsel to his bench, where they all viewed the clip on a laptop. The sound of Dlamini s screams and pleading were loud and clearly upset the accused. They were so traumatised that the case had to stand down for them until they had regained their composure.Dlamini was allegedly abducted from the Eletsa Secondary School in Letlhabile near Brits on June 18 last year. She was forced into a car and taken out of town before the petrol was doused over her.In her plea, Mosupi said she had heard about her boyfriend s relationship with Dlamini, and simply wanted the latter to leave her boyfriend alone.Pretoria News
