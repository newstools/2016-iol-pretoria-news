President Jacob Zuma has faced a backlash from opposition parties questioning his decision to request the court to postpone next Tuesday&apos;s application to interdict the &#x201C;state capture&#x201D; report.Zuma wants the court to stop the release of the report and reopen the investigation into state capture because he wanted to question the witnesses, including his cabinet ministers.But this has angered opposition parties, who said yesterday that they would oppose Zuma&#x2019;s request to postpone Tuesday&#x2019;s hearing in the high court in Pretoria.The DA, Cope and UDM said this was another delaying tactic by Zuma to block the release of the report. They said Zuma had had from March 22 but failed to respond to questions sent to him by former public protector Thuli Madonsela.But Zuma is now demanding that the investigation into state capture be reopened.Madonsela had indicated that her report was final. This was before she left office and Zuma interdicted the release of the report.DA leader Mmusi Maimane said they would not allow Zuma to use delaying tactics as parties wanted the report released.The DA is one of the intervening parties in the state capture report and Maimane lodged a complaint with Madonsela immediately after allegations of state capture emerged in March.Political Bureau IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
