Pretoria - Clashes between students and police erupted at the University of Pretoria in the early hours of Monday morning.The students were unhappy about a smartphone application launched to assist them with their studies while the institution remains closed due to ongoing #FeesMustFall impasse.They held a night vigil on Sunday, but it turned ugly when the students clashed with police and private security personnel in the morning. We were marching to the university's Prospect gate. Police came and threw stun grenades at and tried to disperse us, said a student. We are against this e-learning programme because we didn't pay tuition to self-study. I paid so I could go to class. But Tuks has been insensitive about the fees issue, they have not been sympathetic and that's why we are protesting. Pretoria News
