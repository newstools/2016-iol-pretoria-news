Rehad Desai, director of the Emmy Award-winning Miners Shot Down, releases his follow-up film, The Giant is Falling, on Friday night.The film is co-directed by first-time director, Jabulani Mzozo.Desai decided to have the premiere of the film at the first edition of the Johannesburg Film Festival, which also opens on Friday night.&#x201C;It feels so right that we are opening the film in South Africa,&#x201D; Desai says. &#x201C;This is a film about our present reality. The film raises questions about whether the big events we&#x2019;ve seen in the past few years, including the brutality we saw at Marikana and the high octane battles over tertiary education, are an inevitable outcome of the inequality we inherited.&#x201C;Given the nature of this film, we do not expect to get a local broadcast any time soon, so catch it while you can.&#x201D;The European premiere will take place at the International Documentary Festival in Amsterdam next month.Shot over two years, and supported by a number of international broadcasters, The Giant is Falling provides an inside look at the big political events of recent years that seemingly signify the dying days of the ANC.Locating the moment when things fell apart at the Marikana massacre, the film charts the various ways in which people have collectively responded to the ANC&#x2019;s failure to deliver on its promises.From the end of its special relationship with the trade unions to the #FeesMustFall student movement and the more recent crushing electoral losses at the polls, the thread is the inequality that is making the current status quo untenable.The inaugural Joburg Film Festival comes to multiple venues across the city from Friday night, October 28, to November 5 with a powerful line-up that includes six world and 26 Africa premieres.Included in the programme, are: Black Girl (Wednesday at 6pm): This magnificent African classic from the continent&#x2019;s greatest director, the late Senegalese film-maker, Ousmane Sembane, explores the complex dynamics of the immediate post-colonial period through the simple, devastating story of a servant, Diouana, brought to Antibes by a French couple previously stationed in Dakar.
