Pretoria - A former estate agent is suing a specialist surgeon for failing to detect a 9cm broken blade of a kitchen knife lodged in her throat after she was attacked in her home.It was only after Dorina Ward, originally from Joburg, but who now lives in the Western Cape, detected blood in her mouth that the broken blade was discovered.Ward was stabbed several times in the neck during the attack in her security estate home, and her wounds bled so much that she slipped and fell in her own blood.The 65-year-old woman walked around with the broken blade in her neck for about two weeks before it was removed in an emergency operation.She is claiming the damages in the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, from the specialist, Dr Mabudi Costa Bope.However, he has denied negligence and said he couldn&apos;t be held liable for her ordeal. He said she should have joined the MEC for Health in Gauteng as a party in the action, as he had no obligation in this instance toward her.Ward was attacked in her home on September 21, 2010, and she was, among other wounds, stabbed in the neck with a vegetable carving knife. She was admitted to the Morningside Medi-Clinic.She was seen by the doctor on duty, who referred her to a surgeon. It is said that the surgeon did not see her, examine her or order that X-rays be taken of her neck. She was sent home with the blade still lodged in her neck.It is claimed the surgeon only spoke to the staff over the phone regarding Ward&#x2019;s condition and never physically saw her.Another surgeon, who submitted a report as an expert witness on behalf of Ward, questioned how a doctor could &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153;take care&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D; of a patient, with potentially lethal complications, telephonically.It is claimed that he discharged her over the phone, via the nursing staff of the hospital.Ward said in court papers that the neck wound was &#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x153;major&#xE2;&#x20AC;&#x9D; and she described it being the size of an apple or a tennis ball.The expert who submitted a report on her behalf said a diligent doctor would have send her for X-rays.An X-ray examination in the emergency room would have hardly taken any time at all, he said.The blade would have been apparent on the X-ray negatives and it could have been removed.The surgeon against whom she is claiming damages was on call in the emergency unit at the time.He was not present, but handled her case via the telephone.Ward&#x2019;s expert said a surgeon with the defendant&#x2019;s qualifications should have known that a deep, penetrating wound in the neck was serious and must be examined.It is claimed the surgeon simply phoned the staff and when he heard Ward was stable, he discharged her telephonically.Ward was taken care of by her family at home, but she was continuously aware that something was not right with her neck wound, it was claimed.Relying on the specialist, she, as a lay person, thought it was a normal symptom of her attack.Two weeks later, on her birthday, she had coffee and was puzzled when she tasted blood in her mouth.She went to hospital where the shocking find was made.The knife&#x2019;s blade narrowly missed the vital, large vascular vein in her neck.It was said that she narrowly escaped having her facial muscles paralysed owing to the stab wound.She was described by the expert as being extremely lucky that the blade did not cause more damage.However, she had suffered severely on an emotional front due to the alleged initial mismanagement of her case.It is said that while she had difficulty coming to terms with the attack on her, the fact that she had a near-death experience due to alleged medical negligence traumatised her.Her expert recommended that not only the surgeon be held accountable, but also the emergency unit doctors and hospital nursing management.They are all to blame, he said.The surgeon should also be reported to the Health Professions Council of South Africa for unbecoming conduct, he said.The matter was postponed to a date yet to be determined, as some of the parties have to file their papers.
