Pretoria - Students marching to the Union Buildings said on Thursday they did not have a memorandum to hand over, because they had written to President Jacob Zuma before, and he knew their demands very well.Police have said that permission for the march has been denied, making it illegal, because student leaders could not confirm who would be receiving their memorandum at the Union Buildings.No violence has been reported in Pretoria as the hundreds of students march from Church Square to the Union Buildings demanding free education.The students passed the Tshwane University of Technology, where they recruited more protesters.From there, they proceeded to the Sheraton Hotel where they were met by about 100 #OutsourcingMustFall workers, who embarked on a strike on Thursday morning.The two groups burst into a song outside the hotel, calling on the hotel&#x2019;s management to address the demands of the workers.The group consists of various students from all the tertiary institutions in Pretoria, including the University of Pretoria, Sefako Makgatho, as well as technical and vocational educational and training colleges.Since the march was not approved, the students are having to negotiate the route with the police as they proceed to the Union Buildings.
