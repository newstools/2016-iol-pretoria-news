Pretoria - The Congress of SA Students (Cosas) has threatened to occupy the office of Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi if he fails to take action against the Pretoria High School for Girls staff accused of racism.Cosas also said it would fight fire with fire by occupying the classrooms of those teachers until replacements had been appointed.The youth movement said it was angry because the investigation into claims of racism by pupils at the school promised by Lesufi two months ago was still ongoing and taking too long. Cosas leader in Gauteng Thabang Mahlomusa said they were deeply disappointed with the MEC&#x2019;s absence at their lekgotla, where he was expected to provide an update on the investigation.&#x201C;We had hoped he would be at the lekgotla because it would have given him an opportunity to inform us how the investigation was going,&#x201D; Mahlomusa said.&#x201C;Now we plan on occupying his office because we are tired of how this whole issue is being handled.&#x201D;Mahlomusa was speaking after a Cosas provincial meeting.Cosas aborted its plans to protest on the second day of the new school term last week to express its unhappiness with the delays.&#x201C;We decided it wouldn&#x2019;t be wise to take our members out of classrooms to be a part of a march when we have exams soon. It wouldn&#x2019;t be in their interests. But one of our resolutions was that we are tired of talks and marches - no more. We are going to fight fire with fire.Pupils at Pretoria High School for Girls declared enough was enough when allegedly told to straighten their hair. Subsequently, schools and various movements and celebrities across the country joined the protest.The girls listed other complaints, including that they were forbidden from speaking in their home language while at school and that they felt discriminated against by hair policies that were not appropriate for black girls. A series of meetings had been held between all stakeholders and the probe is ongoing, but it was taking longer than initially thought, according to Cosas.Lesufi visited the school and appointed a committee to investigate the allegations following a meeting with the girls, parents, management and the school governing body.The MEC suspended the school hair rules and gave the committee 21 days to submit a preliminary report.Acting departmental spokesman Oupa Bodibe has said internal processes had to be complied with before an independent investigator was appointed. The 21 days could only start once this had been done.&#x201C;Some teachers and pupils still had to be interviewed, and that only happened after the break. Given that the issue is of a very sensitive nature, we do not want to be pressurised into making any public pronouncement,&#x201D; he added.Most parents indicated they were happy with the progress, especially because a new code of conduct on hair was issued.
