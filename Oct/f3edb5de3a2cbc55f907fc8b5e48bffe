Pretoria - A Kempton Park woman is claiming more than R28 million in damages from three specialists after she developed a life-threatening side-effect due to the use of anti-epileptic medication which led to liver failure.Michelle Vosloo, 22, subsequently had to undergo a liver transplant.According to a neurologist, she never had epilepsy and did not require any epileptic medication.Another expert said that without the results from scans, it was difficult to say whether she suffered from epilepsy or not.Vosloo is suing the three specialist in the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, for medical negligence - for allegedly misdiagnosing her and prescribing her the medication which apparently led to her liver failure.It was said in court papers that during 2013 she had episodes of blackouts.These happened at work where she &#x201C;fell asleep&#x201D;, but she did not remember she had passed out.Vosloo only became aware of the episodes because a co-worker at the insurance company where she worked noticed them.She sometimes passed out on the keyboard of her computer and on occasions in the bathroom.According to the experts, she denied ever biting her tongue, cheeks or lips during these episodes.She was referred to a specialist, who in May 2013 diagnosed her as suffering from epilepsy and placed her on the drugs Lamictin (an anticonvulsant) and Epilim (for epilepsy). Another doctor later increased the dose.The expert said in a medical report to court that episodes of loss of consciousness were commonly due to epileptic fits, but there could also be other causes.It was also said that misdiagnoses of epilepsy remained a major clinical problem and that the diagnoses required a detailed history from the patient.According to Vosloo&#x2019;s medical history, she consulted her general practitioner about the blackouts.She was referred to a neurologist, who without tests, told her she may have epilepsy and placed her on medication. She developed influenza-like symptoms and later a rash.It was then suggested she might have measles. When her condition got worse, a doctor told her she might have liver problems.Tests for hepatitis proved negative, but it was established that she had an abnormal liver function.Vosloo was admitted to hospital on July 31, 2013, for liver failure. By that time she fell into a coma and her family later told her she had to undergo a liver transplant.While she was not at present experiencing any problems with her new liver, she was suffering from a few side effects, including headaches.She also restricted her diet and had to avoid crowded spaces as there was a fear she may be exposed to excessive germs and possible infection.However, she will have to undergo various medical procedures. Her future medical and related expenses were estimated at R19m.It was ruled at a previous hearing that the doctors were liable to pay her damages. The extent of her damages would be determined later.
