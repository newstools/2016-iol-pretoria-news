Pretoria - Support for Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan is growing ahead of his court appearance on Wednesday.The latest to add their voice against fraud-related charges laid against Gordhan was a group of activists for justice from Joburg and Pretoria.They staged a demonstration outside Sars offices in Brooklyn on Friday to express their support for Gordhan.They hoisted placards that read &#x201C;Hands off our Treasury&#x201D;, &#x201C;Stop the looting&#x201D; and &#x201C;Save our institutions&#x201D;.Gordan&#x2019;s court appearance relates to fraud charges brought against him by the NPA.The charges have been repeatedly described by Gordhan as being politically motivated.They relate to the early retirement of Gordhan&#x2019;s former deputy commissioner at Sars Ivan Pillay.Activists&apos; Movement for Justice said it was time ordinary citizens had a voice against wrongdoings in the country.Movement spokeswoman Kelly Pillay said the public persecution of Gordhan&#x2019;s character had galvanised ordinary citizens into a fight against corruption.She said activists met to show their support for Gordhan who is scheduled to appear at the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria, on November 2.&#x201C;We also want democracy to be upheld in the country.&#x201D;Pillay said the group believed charges laid against the trio were frivolous and there were more serious issues to focus on in the country.&#x201C;We don&#x2019;t believe that charges against them will hold any ground in court,&#x201D; she said.The apparent onslaught launched against Gordhan had become an wake-up call to South Africans to stand up against wrongdoings.&#x201C;We have been silent for too long,&#x201D; Pillay said.
