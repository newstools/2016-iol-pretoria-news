Rapula Moatshe and Sakhile NdlaziPretoria - Pretoria is at a standstill on Wednesday morning with DA, EFF and Save South Africa supporters all marching in a move that has shut down the capital city.At the same time, the battle for the release of the so-called state capture report of former public protector Thuli Madonsela is resuming in the Gauteng High Court, Pretoria.The marches were originally organised to coincide with the appearance in the Pretoria Regional Court of Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan, but the parties decided to go ahead even after fraud charges against him were dropped.Motorists were turned away while entering the city centre, where EFF members clashed with taxi drivers near Bosman Street. The EFF members were attempting to turn back taxis when drivers dared them to touch their vehicles.The EFF, which held a night vigil at Church Square, has been the most vocal, singing since the early hours of the morning.The Save South Africa crowd, who are gathered near the St Alban&#x2019;s Cathedral, also burst into a song ahead of the people&#x2019;s assembly.&#x201C;This movement is not aligned to any political party. We&apos;re here to save our lives,&#x201D; Anele Yawa, general secretary of the Treatment Action Campaign, said at a Save South Africa gathering early on Wednesday morning.&#x201C;We thought 1994 was the end of oppression. Corruption is affecting service delivery and we&apos;re not going to fold hands,&#x201D; Yawa said.Struggle stalwart Cheryl Carolus added: &#x201C;We don&apos;t believe President Jacob Zuma is right to lead the ANC or this country .&#x201D;She was echoed by ANC veteran Sipho Pityana, who said: &#x201C;&#x201D;As long as we have Jacob Zuma as president, it is not possible to turn things around in this country.&#x201C;We&apos;ve written to request a meeting with (Zuma) but his door is firmly shut,&#x201D; Pityana said.Police are manning almost all intersections in the Pretoria CBD, making it difficult for motorists to access the area.Most businesses are closed, and the glass windows of one shop near Church Square were smashed.All marchers are echoing choruses for President Jacob Zuma to resign, while the EFF is also demanding free education and the release of the state capture report.Tshwane Metro Police Department spokesman Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said there had been reports of people taking advantage of the marches to cause disturbances in Paul Kruger Street next to the Pretoria Zoo.Four people who were throwing stones at motorists have been arrested. The police had the situation under control now, he said.The city police department and SAPS jointly have about 1 000 officers around the CBD, and Mahamba said they expected the marches to be peaceful.Streets that will be affected by the marches: WF Nkomo Street going west, passing Bosman Street, turning left into Sophie Du Bruyn Street, passing Pretorius Street and then turning left into Francis Baard Street. Madiba Street between Bosman and Paul Kruger Street and Francis Baard Street between Bosman and Sophie du Bruyn Street is closed.Motorists are advised to avoid the affected streets and use alternative routes, such as Nana Sita Street, Visagie Street, Es&#x2019;kia Mphahlele Drive and Boom Street. - Addtional reporting by African News Agency Pretoria News
