Johannesburg - Talks were ongoing to deal with water pollution at the Hartbeespoort Dam once and for all, according to its custodian - the Department of Public Works - which was quick to deny polluting the dam.&#x201C;We have noted with concern media reports regarding the pollution of the Jukskei River, which in turn has resulted in the contamination of Hartbeespoort Dam,&#x201D; said department spokesman Thami Mchunu, adding the department had nothing to do with the sewage spill.Last week, the Northern Works Waste Water Treatment Plant in Joburg north released millions of litres of untreated sewage into the Jukskei River. Northern Works is owned by the City of Joburg, through its entity Joburg Water.The river links up with the Crocodile River and then flows into the Hartbeespoort Dam.&#x201C;Joburg Water has a municipal out-fall sewer line that crosses the prison (Leeuwkop) premises, running parallel to the Jukskei River.&#x201C;It is our understanding that the one of the outfall sewer lines has been decommissioned to resolve blockages in the line. This has resulted in spillages into the Jukskei River,&#x201D; Mchunu explained.He said that two of the outfall sewer lines from Bruma and Midrand adjoin in a sewer line passing through Leeuwkop on their way to the Northern Works Waste-water Treatment Plant.The department sent technical experts to the site and made recommendations to resolve the matter together with Joburg Water.&#x201C;The department has written to Joburg Water and the City of Joburg to treat the matter with urgency.&#x201D;In addition to the sewage spillage, the famous tourist destination is housing even more pollution from the algae and hyacinth accumulating in its waters.Every time it rains or there are flood the pollution from manholes, storm water drains and pump stations contribute to the overall contamination and pollution of the dam.Mchunu said: &#x201C;The core problem is that the municipal out-fall sewer that crosses the prison premises cannot handle the current raw sewage flow rate. One solution suggested is that Joburg Water construct a second bypass conduit sewer pipeline.&#x201D; [email&#160;protected] The Star IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
