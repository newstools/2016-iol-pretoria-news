With that weirdness you'll get far in life,&quot; she said.Sarah Motshekga, one of the recipients, said she was excited yet nervous. She said the award meant she had to put more effort into her work. &quot;I honestly wanted to win this with all my heart, but I was nervous as I did not know who my competitors were,&quot; Motshekga said.Her award recognised a doctoral student for the research contribution made as part of their studies. Motshekga's work focused on producing nanomaterials that could be used to solve problems associated with contaminated water. She published eight articles in high impact journals. &quot;This award shows that my work is making an impact on people's lives and should really get more work done.&quot; The awards take place every two years to recognise good science, talent and appreciate the employees for their dedication and impact they have on the company.CSIR board charman Thokozani Majozi congratulated all the finalists and recipients.
