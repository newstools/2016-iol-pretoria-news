Pretoria - Water blues continue to haunt Tshwane residents as reservoirs run low.Restrictions have apparently been imposed without notice, which goes against government regulations which prescribe a four-day notice period before water shedding is implemented by municipalities.Rand Water says the city is the only municipality in the province struggling to implement water throttling properly.After taps ran dry west and east of the city last week, it was the turn of communities north of the city in Soshanguve and Mabopane to spend the weekend without water.According to city officials, water storage facilities were dangerously low.City spokesman Lindela Mashigo said the main reservoir in Block L Soshanguve was under threat of running dry. &#x201C;In the event it does, it will have a huge impact on water supply to Blocks AA, UU, CC, F, G, WW, VV and Soshanguve east,&#x201D; he said.Mashigo said they were forced to restrict water supply to Mabopane when levels hit a 20% low. &#x201C;The 55 megalitre reservoir is almost depleted,&#x201D; he said.Blocks S and B were under pressure and to avoid further problems the city was left with no option but to implement water shedding in Mabopane on Saturday evening, Mashigo said.&#x201C;The city will be implementing water shedding between 8pm and 5am on a daily basis until capacity in that area reaches 60%,&#x201D; he said.The water woes also hit areas in Pretoria east; and Mashigo sent out an appeal to residents to save water. &#x201C;We are urging them to use water in a frugal manner and prudently as the Garsfontein reservoir is at 27%.&#x201D;Residents east and west of the city and other parts of the capital have suffered from supply interruptions over the past few weeks, leaving city officials scrambling to provide explanations.Burst pipes and contaminated reservoirs were among the reasons given, but when Laudium residents angrily demanded answers after 36 hours without water last weekend, mayor Solly Msimanga blamed Rand Water. He said the provincial supplier of water stepped in and imposed the 15% restriction without informing the metro. City officials were just as shocked, he said.But Rand Water officials rubbished his claims and said they had no means of interfering with municipality water distribution.Rand Water spokesman Justice Mohale said water to the capital and other municipalities was 15% less since August. &#x201C;The city then decided which area to restrict on its own,&#x201D; he said.Tshwane was the only municipality with problems in implementing the throttling declared by the Department of Water and Sanitation, he said.Mohale said the problem was a matter of management.&#x201C;No one should open a tap and find it dry,&#x201D; said another Rand Water official.&#x201C;Throttling has to be implemented in a humane way, and it is illegal for the city not to notify people,&#x201D; said the official, who was not authorised to speak to the media and thus asked not to be named.He said water throttling was not meant to punish people, but to allow them to participate in an orderly way of saving water.Department of Water and Sanitation spokesman Sputnik Ratau said a four-day notice period had to be given to communities before cuts.&#x201C;Before any cuts are imposed there needs to be interaction, and communities must be informed on time. This is to avoid confusion, trauma and a backlash from people who do not know what is going on and could see throttling as punitive. Having no water is a physical and psychological matter; it must not come as a surprise.&#x201D;However, Mashigo said throttling was done in consultation with community leaders. &#x201C;It is expected of all residents to reduce their water consumption by at least 15% in order to keep the taps running.&#x201D; @ntsandvose [email&#160;protected] Pretoria News IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
