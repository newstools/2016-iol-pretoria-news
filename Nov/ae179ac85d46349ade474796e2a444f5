Pretoria - If reports that the Hawks are investigating KZN political heavyweight Zweli Mkhize were true it would mean the start of open conflict in the ANC, which might later lead to President Jacob Zuma being recalled before the end of his term.These were the views of political analyst Somadoda Fikeni on Sunday after a weekend newspaper reported that ANC treasurer-general Mkhize, party secretary-general Gwede Mantashe and deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas were under investigation for failing to report corruption to the police.According to the reports, which came after Zuma visited the Kwa-Zulu-Natal area of eDumbe at the weekend, the three are accused of having broken the law by not reporting to the police that the Guptas had tried to bribe Jonas who had reported the matter to Mantashe and Mkhize.When asked if the reports were true, Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said &#x201C;it is not true&#x201D;.Former public protector Thuli Madonsela&#x2019;s State of Capture report had revealed how the Guptas allegedly offered senior ANC leaders Cabinet positions in return for favours.&#x201C;Given the high level of tension and conflict, there are indications that state institutions have not been spared in the process of being used in this fight,&#x201D; said Fikeni.In 2008 Mkhize gave his backing to Zuma after Zuma&#x2019;s fallout with then president Thabo Mbeki.However, Durban KZN analyst Bheki Mngomezulu said that if the reports were true it would not mean there was a fallout between them (Jonas, Mkhize and Mantashe) and Zuma.&#x201C;Mkhize and Zuma&#x2019;s relations have never been bad. Mkhize was relocated from KZN to work as treasurer-general because Zuma trusted him.&#x201C;Although there are rumours of a fall-out I don&#x2019;t think they are true,&#x201D; he said.&#x201C;Gwede was one of those who had worked hard to protect the reputation of the organisation and that of the president,&#x201D; he said.
