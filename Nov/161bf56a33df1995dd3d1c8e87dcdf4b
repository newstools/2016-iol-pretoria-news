Johannesburg - The ANC has closed ranks around President Jacob Zuma, who has emerged from the party&#x2019;s national working committee (NWC) unscathed and looks likely to again survive Thursday&#x2019;s motion of no confidence against him in Parliament.At the weekend, Zuma rallied his forces in his home province of KwaZulu-Natal in a bid to show he was still powerful and used the platform to send a message to his opponents within the party and outside that he was ready for them.On Tuesday, in what was perhaps a clear indication that Zuma will serve his full term, the NWC resolved that it would be premature to recall the president on the basis of former public protector Thuli Madonsela&#x2019;s damning State of Capture report, which found he had violated the Members&#x2019; Ethics Act.&#x201C;Calls also for the president to step down using the report as a basis are premature and unfounded,&#x201D; said ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe.The ANC also instructed its MPs to vote against the DA&#x2019;s motion of no confidence in Zuma when it is tabled in Parliament&#x2019;s sitting on Thursday. Mantashe called it an &#x201C;annual and frivolous ritual, which is fast losing its meaning&#x201D;.&#x201C;The motion of no confidence has no chance of succeeding,&#x201D; Mantashe said.Tuesday was the second time in six months that Zuma has survived a possible recall by the ANC.Any hope the president would be recalled were quashed in April, after the damning Constitutional Court ruling that found he had failed to uphold the constitution by failing to abide by the public protector&#x2019;s remedial actions on the non-security features at his private Nkandla home in KwaZulu-Natal.Mantashe said his party would not block efforts by those implicated by the preliminary report to take it on review, saying the court challenge would also clarify who should appoint the judge the head the judicial commission of inquiry.This was perhaps the clearest indication of the governing party&#x2019;s major departure from its initial response to State of Capture. The party had initially said it &#x201C;welcomed&#x201D; the report when it was released.Mantashe appeared to insinuate that the EFF had an influence on the recommendation that the appointment of the judge to lead the judicial commission of inquiry be made by Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng.&#x201C;After the local government elections, we had a talk of a coalition with the EFF. In our discussions, they wanted us to set up a commission of inquiry on the Guptas.&#x201C;They did not speak about state capture. We are looking at what is at play here. It is a coincidence we are noting,&#x201D; Mantashe said.He was adamant the constitution empowered Zuma to set up that commission but said all these matters would be clarified when the report was taken for judicial review.&#x201C;The ANC is of the view, however, that the observations and remedial actions in the State of Capture report are inconclusive and contain no binding findings conferring guilt on any party.&#x201C;The report of the public protector rather calls for the establishment of a commission of inquiry into allegations of improper relationships and involvement of private interests in the running of the affairs of the state.&#x201C;As a matter of principle, the ANC supports the setting up of a commission of inquiry. However, due regard must be given to the constitutional prescripts that guide the establishment of such a commission.&#x201D;He said the ANC had considered the State of Capture report seriously and was committed to fighting corruption.
