Johannesburg - Students at the University of Pretoria have intensified their call for the release of student leader Amos &#x201C;Amla&#x201D; Monageng, who has been arrested yet again after being freed on bail.The EFF student leader at Tuks was arrested on Wednesday while at Romans Pizza in Hatfield.Students took to social media platforms, and a #FreeAmla campaign trended over the weekend. Students alleged he was arrested because of &#x201C;an unjust system which criminalises and victimises student activists&#x201D;.They claimed the university management had been behind the arrest, as the registrar was present when Monageng was detained.His arrest was believed to be for a violation of his bail conditions, one of which was that he may not go on to the university campus at which he is suspended. To enter the varsity premises, he must get permission in advance.The conditions tied in with the court interdict granted to the university, so management assisted in looking for and arresting him, according to students who were with Monageng during his arrest.The students refused to comment on whether Monageng had been on campus.Monageng faces charges of malicious damage to property, destroying infrastructure and public violence, and was granted R1 500 bail on October 19. His case was postponed to November 25.&#x201C;He is in an overcrowded prison cell with murderers, rapists and criminals of every kind. We are not allowed to see him and we don&#x2019;t know anything about his safety,&#x201D; the students posted under #FreeAmla.&#x201C;The silence of the University of Pretoria student community, the church and his political organisation is absolutely shocking. What type of society does this? We want justice for Amla Monageng.&#x201D;The university had yet to comment on the matter. The Star IOL News on Facebook IOL on Twitter
