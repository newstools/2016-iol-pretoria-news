Pretoria - Two months after being released on bail, murder accused Mark Warona Zinde has found himself behind bars again - this time for allegedly assaulting his father.The son of the late TV personality and SABC board member Hope Zinde was released on R10 000 bail in September for allegedly murdering his mother.However, he has now been arrested for allegedly assaulting his father, Lesley Manoto, at his Walkerville home, south of Joburg. Manoto, who took him in after he was released on bail, laid charges of assault against his son at De Deur police station.He was arrested and appeared in the Vereeniging Magistrate&apos;s Court, where the matter was postponed to November 28.Manoto told the Pretoria News he did not wish to divulge details surrounding the alleged attack. &#x201C;My son is back in jail, but he hasn&#x2019;t been formally charged.&#x201C;That will be done when he intends applying for bail. At the moment I have nothing to say about what happened. You can hear about the details when his case resumes in court.&#x201D;His reluctance to speak about the matter was based on assuming a united front by Mark&#x2019;s paternal and maternal family.&#x201C;At the moment we do not wish to send out contradictory statements about this issue because we are both working together to ensure this matter is handled carefully,&#x201D; he said.When he appeared in the Brits Regional Court over his mother&apos;s murder in September, the State opposed a bail application. It cited reasons of depression and mood swings and said these would make him unpredictable and a danger to those around him.State Advocate Hanna Conradie said at the time: &#x201C;The applicant has depression. It entails that he has certain mood swings. It will not be in the interest of justice to release him into an environment where there are two young girls and two women.&#x201C;The court needs to consider if there are no possibilities that the applicant can intimidate them or influence them in any way.&#x201D;Zinde shot into the public eye in June after he was arrested over his mother&#x2019;s murder at their Peaconwood Estate home in Hartbeespoort.Hope was found stuffed in the boot of her Jeep.The investigating officer in the murder case testified that he found Hope in the boot of her vehicle after following a trail of blood.&#x201C;When I entered through the front door, there was dry blood on the passage.&#x201C;There were towels and a bucket filled with clean water. I was led to the garage where two vehicles, a Jeep and Mercedes-Benz were parked.&#x201C;I was shown where the applicant had left the body inside the Jeep,&#x201D; Motsepe said.He also testified that it appeared as though a dumbbell was used to assault her.The matter was postponed to November 22.
