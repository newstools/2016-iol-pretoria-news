Pretoria - Failure by the DA-led metro to act against the marchers who vandalised shops last Wednesday proved the city would find it difficult to act against its &#x201C;coalition&#x201D; partner EFF, the SACP has said.SACP provincial secretary Jacob Mamabolo criticised the DA for turning a blind eye to acts of violence and looting that was carried by the EFF in Tshwane.Mamabolo said the development bore testimony to the fact that the EFF now had power in the city and the DA would find it difficult to say or do anything serious about its conduct. He described the conduct of the EFF as nothing short of anarchy.EFF supporters took to the streets in the city to demand the resignation of President Jacob Zuma and protest against state capture.They vandalised and looted shops, emptied dustbins and littered the streets with rubbish.The next day, executive mayor Solly Msimanga led a team that was cleaning up the city. Msimanga famously took over the city&#x2019;s highest office with help from the EFF in local government elections in August.Mamabolo expressed disappointment at the apparent discrimination by the DA when it came to dealing with protesters in the city.He accused the city&#x2019;s ruling party of unfair treatment to marchers aligned to the ANC-led alliance. &#x201C;This is clear from the DA&#x2019;s hypocrisy and double standards when it comes to protest action in the city,&#x201D; he said.What transpired during the march, he said, showed that the DA&#x2019;s failure to act against the EFF&#x2019;s trashing and looting of the city constituted a serious setback for the people of the city.&#x201C;This disastrous failure by the DA to act consistently against EFF seems to suggest a new policy on future protests - that where it suits DA&#x2019;s interests the city may be trashed, vandalised and looted without any action by the DA,&#x201D; he said.Mamabolo said the SACP would watch the space to see how the DA would treat various protests in the city following its selective treatment of protest marches in the city.Following the chaos, Msimanga said they had seen footage of EFF members on a rampage. &#x201C;But I don&#x2019;t want to really zoom into one party. I want to say to the public &apos;why are you letting this happen&apos;?&#x201D;He said four people had been arrested. A metro bus was torched and Msimanga said footage showing people who trashed the bus had been obtained. He said action would be taken against perpetrators if they could be positively identified.He added that he would formulate a policy aimed at holding perpetrators of violence and vandalism to account.
